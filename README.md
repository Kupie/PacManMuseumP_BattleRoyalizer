# PacMan Museum+ BattleRoyalizer mod

I want Pacman Battle Royale in a cabinet, that boots up on a small windows box right to the game

This is more of a personal mod, requires bepinex 5.x:

## Features:
- Skip opening videos/menu and load Battle Royale
- Hide garbage about coins/gold pass
- Hide info about credits as this is personal use
- Adds credits if they're not at 99 (max)


### Planned:
- Hide pause menu elements to exit
- Hide more elements that could be confusing
